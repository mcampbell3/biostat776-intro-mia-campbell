# A Chance to Meet Mia 
this  website contains a short introduction of Mia Campbell

## About Mia
- Mia Campbell, MHS is a trauma-informed yoga instructor, creator, and student-researcher who is passionate about adolescent mental health, movement, and holistic wellness. 
-She is from Queens and Long Island NY and also a proud second-generation immigrant with family from Grenada, West Indies and London, England. Mia completed her undergraduate degree in Biology of Global Health at Georgetown University where she first gained experience with epidemiology and introductory programming for scientists. She has worked in psychiatry and epidemiology labs as a research coordinator and data analyst. She has programming experience with R, MatLab, SAS and STATA and has conducted logistic regression analysis in her work. She has co-authored a book chapter and is currently working on her first first-author publication. 
- In 2020, Mia was awarded a Fulbright grant to conduct adolescent mental health stigma research in India. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic she did not embark on her trip or project. However, Mia pivoted and in 2021 she started at the Bloomberg School of Public Health as a MHS student in the Dept of Mental Health. 
Currently, as a doctoral student at the Bloomberg School of Public Health she uses epidemiological methods in her research to assess mental health inequities among adolescents. She hopes that this statistical computing course will solidfy some of her self taught programming skills and also provide opportunities to work on building a strong foundation for more complex analysis and best practices in future reproducible research!
